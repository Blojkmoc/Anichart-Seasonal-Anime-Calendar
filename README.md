# Anichart-Seasonal-Anime-Calendar
## First Iteration
This repository is created by the idea that is mentioned in https://github.com/Blojkmoc/Anichart-Date-Scraping

This was created on the backbone of the currently hot AI tool ChatGPT that gave me some inspirations on how to improve my previous work. Even though the code example 
that it gave me wasn't perfect, I still managed to debug some errors that it has and I end up with this end product with a much leaner project using GraphQL to query 
for the current seasonal anime that is airing

I have also host this on a free website on Azure below:

https://seasonal-anime-calendar.azurewebsites.net/

The timezone in which this website is based on is GMT+8

This is my personal project and there is no commercial purpose behind this. Hope that you will enjoy it. I will continue to update and add some UI features in the future
